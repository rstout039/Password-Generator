# Password-Generator
This website generates a random new password for every time the generate button is clicked on.
The user is asked a series of prompts on what type of characters they would like to include into the random password. 
# The characters are either uppercase, lowercase, symbols, or letters 
# Such as "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()_+"
The user may choose no more than 128 characters and no less than 8 characters for their random generated password.
The user also has the chance to copy their new password and paste it into the browser.
The previous passwords the user generates are then stored underneath previous passwords.
When the browser is refreshed all the previous passwords disappear and the user is prompted again with the same questions.
